# VOCE-DataCollectionPlatform
This is the code for the VOCE collection platform that implements the methodology described in the article "Speech Stress Assessment using Physiological and Psychological Measures", A. Aguiar, M. Kaiseler, H. Meinedo, T. Abrudan and P. R. Almeida, 2nd ACM Workshop on Mobile Systems for Computational Social Science at Ubicomp, 2013.

The DesktopControlApplication folder contains the source code for the Java application that runs on the PC that controls the data collection workflow (we used it on an eePC).

The EclipseAndroidProject contains the Eclipse project with the source code for the Android app that should run on the smartphone to which the heart rate device Zephyr HxM BT (http://www.zephyranywhere.com/products/hxm-bluetooth-heart-rate-monitor) connects. 

We used a high definition microphone (AKG PW45 SPORT SET B1) that communicated through proprietary RF with a base station connected through a high resolution A/D converter (M-AUDIO FAST TRACK) to the PC.
